# BMI8540project: Medical Student Mental Health & Empathy Database & Website
## ABSTRACT/PURPOSE:
An overview of your report and the research question it answers with brief results
## PROJECT OBJECTIVES/GOALS: 
Provide 2 or more concise, specific, and measurable 1-2 line statement that describes the objectives or goals of your project.
## BACKGROUND: 
#### This project does not require much background in order to understand it. I've provided information directly on the website that will help explain the data and have provided a link to the research paper where this data came from.
#### I am someone who works in medical education and we are always trying to find ways to make a safe environment for medical students to learn and practice their skills. We want them to fail and learn from their mistakes without worrying they will hurt someone. Understanding a medical students mental health and empathy plays a part in this.
#### I'm certain that something similar already exists. I know this isn't the only set of data that has been used to research medical student mental health and/or empathy. I would hope that someone can access all of the data from these projects and compare/contrast. I just thought it might be helpful to visualize the data and be able to extract information easily.
## Project Components: 
#### A working database implementation
#### A reproducible bash shell script 
#### A Python script for data analysis or visualization 
#### A public facing interface (i.e. webpage)
## Documentation: 
All code should well-documented (i.e. through a README file, user manual, on-line help, or tutorials). Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards used.

All code or methods needed to implement the project are included and clearly described in the documentation (such as a README file or homepage)
An appropriate license for the project should be included.
