# BMI8540project: Medical Student Mental Health & Empathy Database & Website
## ABSTRACT/PURPOSE:
An overview of your report and the research question it answers with brief results
## PROJECT OBJECTIVES/GOALS: 
Provide 2 or more concise, specific, and measurable 1-2 line statement that describes the objectives or goals of your project.
## BACKGROUND: 
Provides any background needed  for a fellow BMI 8540 student to understand your project. Please provide the actual background knowledge (i.e. "SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19" ðŸ™‚) instead of meta-background information ("Users will need to know what SARS-CoV-2 is"ðŸ˜ž - this is not what I want).
State the biological or health motivation for building the database
Why is this project significant or needed in your field?
Novelty - Does a version of this project exist elsewhere? How is your proposed project different, if at all? If you are proposing a nucleotide database you could note the existence of NCBI Nucleotide and why yours is different (obviously yours would be smaller but may be for a specific set of bacterial isolates, for example)
## Project Components: 
Clearly describe which two (or more) components you chose to implement (only two are required!):
A working database implementation
A reproducible bash shell script 
A Python script for data analysis or visualization 
A public facing interface (i.e. webpage)
## Documentation: 
All code should well-documented (i.e. through a README file, user manual, on-line help, or tutorials). Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards used.
All code should be commented with descriptive, useful comments.
Code is written in such a way that it could be reproduced if needed, including any methods or scripts used to download or otherwise grab data.
All code or methods needed to implement the project are included and clearly described in the documentation (such as a README file or homepage)
An appropriate license for the project should be included.
## DATA PROVENANCE: 
The origin or provenance of all data used in the project is explicitly stated or otherwise attributed. (Data that does not belong to the student or that cannot be shared should NOT be posted in your repository, but please do describe its origin, ownership, and how/where you accessed it).
USERS: Identify the 2-3 types of users that you anticipate would possibly use this project. Users may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of project functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience.
## IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS: 
Describe any items or issues that limited the options available to you when implementing your project.
## REFERENCES: 
In providing background and motivation information, it is expected that you would cite current literature or other research artifacts. Alternatively, you can cite code libraries, GitHub projects, or other software that may have helped you in implementing your project. At least 8 citations should be provided in a consistent format of your choosing with in-text citations used.
## PRIVACY: 
Specify whether or not your database is subject to any privacy requirements
## ORIGINALITY: 
Your final report will be reviewed for originality. All work should be your own. This includes the use of Artificial Intelligence based tools such as ChatGPT.
